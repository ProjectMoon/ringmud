RingMUD Preferences module: Manage system preferences
usage: ringmud.sh prefs <get | set> prefName [prefValue]

The preferences module gets and sets system preferences. These preferences are
rather low-level and stored using the Java Preferences API. On UNIX-like
systems, they are stored in flat files. In Windows, the registry is used.

This module shouldn't need to be used generally, but it exists in case it does
need to be used. Currently it only stores the location of the MUD's config
directory.
