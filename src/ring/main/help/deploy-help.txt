RingMUD Deploy module: Deploy a MUD
usage: ringmud.sh compile <directory>

The RingMUD deployer deploys a MUD compiled with the RingMUD compiler. The
deployer is semi-intelligent; it will update XML files and code files that
have changed, as well as add new ones. If there are ANY code changes, the
entire deployment directory is remade from scratch.

XML updates are slightly less invasive, and only individual documents will be
deleted and recreated if they have been updated.

After deployment is complete, a cleanup of the database will take place, and
any broken references will be removed. This makes sure that there are no
useless referential game object definitions sitting around.

See the website for more directions on developing a MUD for the RingMUD engine.
