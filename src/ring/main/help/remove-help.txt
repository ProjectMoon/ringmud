RingMUD Remove module: Remove XML from the database
usage: ringmud.sh remove <docID> [docID2 ...]

The remove module removes XML documents from the database. It locates documents
by document ID. Normally, the document ID is the same as the filename that was
originally imported into the database.

The remove module will remove all documents, specified in the list as command
line arguments, from the STATIC collection. You cannot remove from the game
collection. As the module attempts to remove documents, it will report on the
status of each removal.
