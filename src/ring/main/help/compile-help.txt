RingMUD Compile module: Compile a MUD
usage: ringmud.sh compile <directory>

The RingMUD compiler (rmc) compiles MUDs designed to run on top of the RingMUD
engine. Several steps are performed to fully compile a MUD for use. First, the
existence of a mud.properties file in the target directory is tested. Next, the
properties file itself is validated.

The second step is data validation. Python-based data files are converted to 
their corresponding XML documents. Then, validation is performed against all
XML data files using the schemas located in the ringmud-resources jar file.

Finally, assuming no errors have been found, the MUD is packed into a .mud file
that can be deployed to the server.

See the website for more directions on developing a MUD for the RingMUD engine.
