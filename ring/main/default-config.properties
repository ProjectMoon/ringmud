#RINGMUD MAIN CONFIGURATION FILE
#
#Contains almost all of the settings for the MUD you will ever need to change.
#Most of the values in here should work fine for your platform. They will only
#need to change if you wish to change the data directories or wish to enable
#special options for the MUD, such as secure mode.
#
#Not all of the properties here are necessarily implemented yet. Keep that in
#mind as this is a beta.

#Main MUD server options: address, port, etc
#server.address: IP address the server will listen on. Default is localhost.
#server.port: Port the server will listen on. Default is 2312.
#server.maxConnections: Max number of simultaneous connections. 0 is unlimited
#server.secure: off | on. Enables use of the integrated SSH server for secure
#               user communication. Default is off.
#server.secure.port: The port for the SSH to listen on. Default is 2314.

#Persistence and data storage options
#Loader classes: These specify the Java classes used to load data into the MUD.
#                Resources are held as "references" during MUD execution, to
#                keep them separate from the actual loading detail, as the
#                references will get serialized to player files.
