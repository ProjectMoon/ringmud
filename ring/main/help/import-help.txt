RingMUD Import module: Import XML into the database
usage: ringmud.sh import <file.xml> [file2.xml ...]

The import module imports XML documents into the database. XML documents can
contain any number of different object descriptions within the root <ring>
element. Documents are imported into the STATIC collection. You cannot import
into the game collection.

The import module will validate each document to be imported by attempting to
construct objects from each of the objects defined in the document. It will not
follow inline reference pointers, because the pointers to be referenced may be 
part of the import operation.

Once validated, the document will be imported directly in to the database as it
appears in the file. The module then moves on to the next document, and shows
the success for the previous document.
