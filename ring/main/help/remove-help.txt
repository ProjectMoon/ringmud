RingMUD Remove module: Remove XML from the database
usage: ringmud.sh remove <docID> [docID2 ...]

The remove module removes XML documents from the database. It locates documents
by document ID. Normally, the document ID is the same as the filename that was
originally imported into the database.

The remove module will remove all document IDs specified in the list as command
line arguments, and as it attempts to remove each, it will report on the status
of each one.
