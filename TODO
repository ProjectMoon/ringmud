There's a lot to do off the top of my head:
Current milestone: "game object persistence"

Current activity: rewriting game objects to comply with above milestone.

Other stuff to do on the horizon:
- Integrate NRAPI
- Replace current networking setup with telnetd2 and Apache Mina SSHD
- Combat system
- Sample content
- Provide extension hook points. This is an engine after all.
