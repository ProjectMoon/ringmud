RIngMUD Java MUD Server

RingMUD is an extensible MUD (multi-user dungeon) engine and utility toolset
that draws inspiration from popular tabletop RPG systems and adds a dash or
two of its own flavor. 

It is written in Java and aims to be a complete MUD solution.

Super quick startup instructions:
1. Download eXist 1.4 from http://exist.sourceforge.net
2. Install exist to where ever you want. It has an easy graphical installer.
3. Build ringmud by running "ant" from this directory.
4. cd dist/bin/
5. Start up exist by running startup.sh in its bin directory.,
5. ./ringmud.sh install unix 
	(Windows support coming later)
6. This will "install" ringmud's configuration file to /etc/ringmud,
   as well as create the database collections in eXist.
	NOTE: Don't forget to copy your database login info to the config.
7. Import the sample world file by typing:
   ./ringmud.sh import ../../resources/loc.xml
8. Start RingMUD: ./ringmud.sh server
9. telnet to localhost at port 2312

This should get RingMUD running on localhost with a really crappy sample
world. A better one is coming soon.
