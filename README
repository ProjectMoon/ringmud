RIngMUD Java MUD Server

RingMUD is an extensible MUD (multi-user dungeon) engine and utility toolset
that draws inspiration from popular tabletop RPG systems and adds a dash or
two of its own flavor. 

It is written in Java and aims to be a complete MUD solution.

Build RingMUD with ant.

You will also need to install eXist to use RingMUD.
